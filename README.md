| Program Name                     | Problem Statement                    |
| :-----------------------------:  | :--------------------------------    |
|[23260A01.cpp](23260A01.cpp)|Create a class named weaather report that holds a daily weather report with data members day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp, amount_rain, amount_snow. Use different types of constructors to initialize the objects. Also include a function that prompts the user and sets the value for each field so that you can override the default values. Write a menu driven program in C++ with options toenter data and generate a monthly report that displays average of each attribute. (The contructor initialises the fields with default values: 99 for day_of_month, 999 for hightemp, -999 for lowtemp, and 0 for amount_rain and amount_snow).|
|[23260A02.cpp](23260A02.cpp)|A Book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as title author, publisher, price and available stock. Write a program in C++ which will have a class called books with suitable member functions for<br>1.Add<br>2.Update<br>3.Search a book<br>4.Purchase a book (update the stock and display the total cost)<br>5.Record number of successful/unsuccessful transactions<br>(use static data members to keep count of transactions) Use new operator in constructors to allocate memory space required.|
|[23260A03.cpp](23260A03.cpp)|Write a program to design a class 'Complex' with data members for real and imaginary parts. Provide default and parameterised constructors. Wrtie a program to perform arithmetic operations of 2 complex numbers using operator overloading. i. Addition and Subtraction using friend function<br>ii. Multiplication and Division using member function.|
|[23260A04.cpp](23260A04.cpp)|Design a base class with name, date of birth, blood group and another base class consisting of the data members such as height and weight. Design one more base class consisting of the insurance policy number and contact address. The derived class contains the data members’ telephone numbers and driving license number. Write a menu driven program to carry out the following things:<br>i. Build a master table<br>ii.  Display Record<br>iii.  Insert  a record<br>iv.  Delete record<br>v.  Edit  record<br>vi.  Search  for a record|
|[23260A05.cpp](23260A05.cpp)|Multiple Inheritance. Create employee bio-data using following classes<br>i. Personal record<br>ii. Professional record<br>iii. Academic record<br>Assume appropriate data members and member function to accept required data & print bio-data. Create bio-data using multiple inheritance using C++.|
|[23260A06.cpp](23260A06.cpp)|Inheritance using Virtual function. Create a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of figure. Derive two classes’ triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area.|
|[23260A07.cpp](23260A07.cpp)|Write a program in C++ which inlcudes the code for the following operations:<br>i.   A function to read two double type values from the keyboard.<br>ii.  A function to calculate division the division of these two numbers.<br>iii. A try block to detect and throw an execution if the condition of "divide by zero" occurs<br>iv.  Appropriate catch block to handle the exception|
|[23260A08.cpp](23260A08.cpp)| Write a program in C++ using function/class template to read two matries of different data types such as integers and floating point values and perform simple arithmetic operators on matrices seperately and display it.|
|[23260A09.cpp](23260A09.cpp)| Write a C++ that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file and opens it again as an input file and reads the information in it.|
|[23260A010.cpp](23260A10.cpp)|Write a program in C++ to implement sequential file for students' database and perform the following operations on it.<br>i.Create<br>ii.Display<br>iii.Add<br>iv.Delete<br>v. Modify|
